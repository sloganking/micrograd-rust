# micrograd-rust
 
Building my own Neural networks in Rust. Inspired by Andrej Karpathy's [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) and [related video](https://youtu.be/VMj-3S1tku0?si=0AJEx-81hEmTKzqf). Somewhat influenced by [rustygrad](https://github.com/Mathemmagician/rustygrad).

## Installation
- You must have [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/) installed for the graph pngs to be generated.
